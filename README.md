## About ##

JewLogger is a packetlogger developed by Quackster, which supports the Shockwave versions of Habbo.

By working as being a man-in-the-middle type program there is the ability to sniff incoming and outgoing packets, and to also send new packets to the server and client.

If you get offended at the name, I'm not sorry. Its purpose is to be provocative
